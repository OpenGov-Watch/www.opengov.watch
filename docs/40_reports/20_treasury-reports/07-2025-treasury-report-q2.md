### About this Report

The Polkadot DAO manages millions of USD in assets. As such, it follows accounting best practices and pioneers them for the Web3 space. The report comes with a balance sheet and income statement. The balance sheet will give a complete overview of all active accounts the Treasury manages and how assets are distributed over its operations. The income statement will break down the categories in which the Treasury spends.

We express our gratitude to the Web3 Foundation for funding this report as part of the **OpenGov.Watch** initiative. Thanks also to the OpenSquare team for providing an API to fetch spending data via their [dotreasury.com](http://dotreasury.com/) project, as well as the Parity data team for providing additional data.

### Introduction to the Polkadot Treasury

To help newcomers to Polkadot read this report, we want to begin by offering a few ideas that guide the strategic decision-making of many voters. DAO contributors (”agents”) ensure that the Treasury aligns on strategic initiatives:

- As the guiding strategic principle, Polkadot is committing to the core vision of Web3: **Apps that put users back in control of the Internet!** Its ecosystem has to be understood as the **Polkadot Cloud**. A complete stack of Web3 services that allow builders to create powerful and scalable applications and business cases at a fraction of the cost of other ecosystems.
- **Polkadot is unstoppable. It sustains itself.**
Research, development, and operations all focus on delivering secure and resilient core Web3 infrastructure. Bridges, wallets, data services, SDKs, governance and developer tooling, and nodes are all paid for by OpenGov. As a result, the network is not dependent on external
organizations.
- **Polkadot’s growth thesis is centered on enterprise adoption in key verticals.** Its business development and market operations are focused on winning market share in (1) DeFi, RWA & Fintech, (2) Gaming & Entertainment, (3) AI & DePin, (4) Social and Identity, and (5) GovTech. Decentralized business development teams work with investors, accelerators, and ecosystem support teams to help teams onboard and succeed in Polkadot.
- **Polkadot is developing its talent pool.** The Polkadot Blockchain Academy provides multi-week in-person education to hundreds of founders and developers multiple times per year to provide new projects with qualified personnel. In addition, hackathons around the globe expose thousands of devs each year to Polkadot’s tech stack.
- **Polkadot’s outreach effort is unmatched by any other DAO.** From content creation in Polkadot-native media brands to distribution, to advertising. From market research to running a decentralized ambassador program and hosting and participating in global events. All of these functions are now operated by the DAO, removing the risks of single points of failure.
- **OpenGov is differentiating into specialized departments**, scaling up its throughput capacity. Dedicated departments composed of domain experts are forming around key ecosystem functions (e.g. marketing, FinTech integrations, etc) to streamline the processing of related proposals. This reduces the load on the main OpenGov voting tracks and allows stakeholders to focus on high-level decisions.

## Balance Sheet

The **balance** of the Polkadot DAO at the end of 2025-Q1 comes out at 33.5m DOT / 135m USD. Accounting for liabilities, there is a **surplus** of 32.6m DOT / 131m USD.

### Assets

![assets.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/assets.png)

You can find the full sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12p6HLw5Mclnw93WnQH9jF-fF5wPdkDiN0_oSWzht59Q/edit?gid=949038484#gid=949038484).

#### Assets Structure

![Polkadot Treasury Assets by Category - 2025-06-30.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/Polkadot_Treasury_Assets_by_Category_-_2025-06-30.png)

For the balance sheet, we structure the assets as follows:

- Cash and cash equivalents: 22m DOT / 76m USD
- Designated assets: 6.4m DOT / 22m USD
- Non-custodial liquidity provision: 1m DOT / 3.5m USD
- Loans receivable: 1.5m DOT / 5m USD

#### Cash and Cash Equivalents (22m DOT / 76m USD)

This category consists of DOT, USDT, and USDC which are immediately or very quickly available for the Treasury's use. Cash is held on the relay chain and AssetHub system chain.

- [Relay Chain](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/13UVJyLnbVp9RBZYFwFGyDvVd1y27Tt8tkntv6Q7JVPhFsTB): 11.1m DOT (38m USD)
- [AssetHub](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/account/14xmwinmCEz6oRrFdczHKqHgWNMiCysE2KrA4jXXAAM1Eogk):
    - 4.1m DOT (14m USD)
    - 800k USDT (235k DOT)
    - 3.2m USDC (950k DOT)

In addition, two trustless and fully automated stablecoin acquisition campaigns are currently running on the Hydration DeFi chain:

- [Stablecoin acquisition campaign #2](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1104) still has about 1.6m DOT (5.6m USD) [to be swapped](https://hydration.subscan.io/account/7KCp4eenFS4CowF9SpQE5BBCj5MtoBA3K811tNyRmhLfH1aV?tab=transfer) within 2025.
- [Stablecoin acquisition campaign #3](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1501) has 4.1m DOT (13.9m USD) [to be swapped](https://hydration.subscan.io/account/7N4oFqXKgeTXo6CMSY9BVZdHP5J3RhQXY77Fe7qmQwjcxa1w) until 2026-Q2

#### Designated Assets (6.4m DOT / 22m USD)

Designated assets are assets that are under the control of OpenGov, but are already earmarked for specific duties, primarily to fund the DAOs executive bodies (bounties and collectives). In addition, Polkadot holds 344k USD in MYTH to be deployed through airdrops to DOT holders.

**Bounties**

Polkadot has 13.1m USD (3.9m DOT) sitting in [bounties](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties), ready to be distributed to teams that perform value-adding activities in the ecosystem. (To learn more about how to request funding, book a free consultation [here](https://www.opengov.watch/booking))

**Technical Fellowship**

The Polkadot Technical Fellowship is the core maintainer of the runtime. It is funded through the DAO. The Fellowship has two accounts:

- [Salary account](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/account/13w7NdvSR1Af8xsQTArDtZmVvjE8XhWNdL4yed3iFHrUNCnS?tab=transfer): 1.7m USDT (503k DOT)
- [Spending account](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/account/16VcQSRcMFy6ZHVjBvosKmo7FKqTb8ZATChDYo8ibutzLnos): 1.9m DOT (6.6m USD)

**MYTH Airdrop**

As part of Polkadot’s strategic partnership with Mythical, it acquired MYTH tokens in exchange for 1m DOT. 2.6m USD-equivalent of MYTH were already distributed to DOT holders and service providers. A remaining reserve of 345k USD-equivalent MYTH remains within the MYTH distribution account to be used in the future.

#### Non-Custodial Liquidity Provision (1m DOT / 3.5m USD)

The Treasury deploys some of its idle capital into the Polkadot economy. [1m DOT](https://app.hydration.net/liquidity/my-liquidity?account=7KQx4f7yU3hqZHfvDVnSfe6mpgAT8Pxyr67LXHV6nsbZo3Tm&id=5) (3.5m USD) sits in the Hydration Omnipool as DOT liquidity.

#### Loans Receivable (1.5m DOT / 5m USD)

These positions are the custodial counterparts of non-custodial liquidity provision.

- [1.5m USDT](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/account/16hdUXXYjoBQBpdQ14z7qk372rwNHkdQJ9YyBuPaXiZcqnru) has been deployed to [Centrifuge RWA Yield Pool](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1122)
- Bifrost has [deployed 1m DOT into its liquid staked DOT product](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/1538)
- Pendulum has [borrowed 50k DOT for its stablecoin bridge vaults](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/748)

#### Assets Portfolio

![Polkadot Treasury Asset Portfolio - 2025-06-30 (3).png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/Polkadot_Treasury_Asset_Portfolio_-_2025-06-30_(3).png)

The Treasury holds DOT, aDOT (DOT provided into the Hydration money market), USDT, USDC, and MYTH. The Treasury’s biggest position is in its native asset DOT, with 23m DOT (79m USD) making up 74% of the portfolio. While the Treasury is swapping DOT for stables, it keeps the DOT position in a money market to increase liquidity and earn yield. The aDOT portion of the portfolio makes up 5.7m DOT (19m USD) or 18% overall. The stablecoin portion of the Treasury is 4.6% USDC (4.9m USD) and 2.5% USDT (2.6m USD). MYTH about to be airdropped makes up 0.33% (345k USD).

#### Assets by Chain

![Polkadot Treasury Assets by Chain - 2025-06-30.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/Polkadot_Treasury_Assets_by_Chain_-_2025-06-30.png)

Polkadot holds assets on 7 different chains. Parachains are a significant part of the Treasury economy, with 27% of the Treasury’s owned assets being deployed on various DeFi chains like Hydration (23m USD), Bifrost (3.4m USD), Centrifuge (1.5m USD), and Pendulum (170k USD). Polkadot Governance allows decisions to be executed trustlessly across all chains under the Polkadot security umbrella. 73% of the Treasury is held on 3 system chains to be used as free cash and for the various executive bodies.

### Liabilities

![liabilities.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/liabilities.png)

The Polkadot Treasury has introduced a mechanism for claimable future payments. They represent liabilities. We treat them as “claims payable” in the balance sheet. 

- Claims payable in total make up 2.4m USD (720k DOT).
- Wages payable for the Technical Fellowship come out at a maximum of 250k USD (74k DOT) per 28-day cycle.

#### Claims Payable

![claims.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/claims.png)

Claims on future payments have been granted to the amount of 2.7m USD. These consist of 430k DOT and 980k USDT. They last until December 2025.

## Income Statement

![incomestatement.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/incomestatement.png)

For the income statement, we use DOT as the primary unit of account, since it is the unit that the main Treasury income - inflation - is based on. For the expenses section, we will additionally provide a USD-denominated table for easier comparison.

Polkadot has had expenses of 6.7m DOT (28m USD) in the second quarter of 2025. After adding revenue, inflation, and burn, the net loss was 2.7m DOT.

![Inflow vs. Outflow (3).png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/Inflow_vs._Outflow_(3).png)

#### Spending Overview

![Polkadot Treasury Spend per Quarter by Category (2).png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/Polkadot_Treasury_Spend_per_Quarter_by_Category_(2).png)

We see a rise in spending in Q2 that is mainly driven by new DeFi incentives to grow the economy. Business Development and Research were again, like in Q1, below their averages. Outreach was more modest too. Operations was again fairly stable and hitting close to its average. Talent & Education spending made a return after 2 quarters of marginal spends.

Now let’s dive a bit into the individual categories!

#### Departments (Bounties & Collectives)

![types.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/types.png)

Departments, (sometimes also referred to as executive bodies) are set up to provide a service in a certain area of the ecosystem. They simplify OpenGov by bundling work in a certain area, reducing mental load and volume on the general voting tracks. Since 2024-Q3, executive bodies have processed ~19% of the total spending, in 2025-Q2 the ratio was 25%. Keep in mind that these costs were already represented in the previous chapters and this is just a different perspective to represent them.

**Bounties**

![bounties.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/bounties.png)

Bounties are similar to departments in traditional organizations. Bounties have a specific mandate to spend money to achieve certain goals. Collectively, **Bounties spent 6.6m USD**, 24% of the total expenses in 2025-Q2. On top, we have the Marketing (2.6m USD) and Events (1.5m USD) bounties, focusing on outreach. DeFi Infrastructure and Tooling (770k USD) focuses onboarding of financial services to the Polkadot Hub. The Infrastructure Builders Program operates crucial node infrastructure, costing 760k USD. The Polkadot Assurance Legion provided security audits worth 210k USD. Paseo did cost 170k USD in the second quarter of 2025. The Games Bounty spent 110k USD.

**Collectives**

For the technical Fellowship, the following salary costs have accrued:

- 2025-04: 105k USD
- 2025-05: 107k USD
- 2025-06: 111k USD

![collectives.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/collectives.png)

In 2025-Q2, the Fellowship Subtreasury paid out two positions, resulting in 29k USD spending.

## Analysis

### Stablecoins

In this chapter, we want to look at the historic and projected stablecoin flows.

#### Historic Stablecoin Flows

![stableflows.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/stableflows.png)

In total, the Treasury has been accumulating 21m USDC and 21m USDT from 2024-03 until the end of 2025-Q2, an average rate of 2.5m USD in stables per month.

Spending has been keeping pace with inflows, with 18m USDC and 20m USDT going to proposers. 1.5m USD of idle USDC was also put into a liquidity loan towards Centrifuge.

Stablecoin acquisition campaign #3 has started in 2025-Q2 and will lead to an inflow of 2.8m USD in stables per month.

Below you see a breakdown of how much has been spent per quarter in DOT, USDC, and USDT, as well as the USD-equivalent of the whole quarter and the ratio of how many stables have been part of the spend per quarter.

![quarters.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/quarters.png)

### Trend

In the long-term trend, we can see that the DOT-denominated balance and cash are trending sidew.ays Since the Treasury is still very heavy on DOT, the overall Treasury value still correlates strongly with the DOT price.

#### Balance Sheet Development

![balancesheet.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/balancesheet.png)

This quarter removed 2m DOT to the balance sheet, highlighting mostly stable spending. The Treasury correlation with the DOT price becomes visible in the USD chart:

![balancesheetdevpng](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/balancesheetdev.png)

#### Treasury Cash Development

![cashdev.png](/img/2025-q2-treasury-report/cashdev.png)

In terms of cash, we see a similar development as with the total balance, which indicates that the overall spending behavior stayed consistent with previous quarters.

        - The Treasury got gifted several memecoins, which we currently do not consider sellable, thus valuing them 0.
        - We use the following guiding principles to assign categories:
            - Categories are assigned by where the primary effect of the spending
            will unfold its value. Titles and descriptions are less relevant here
            than the list of actual deliverables.
            - We consider the perspective of the Polkadot ecosystem. Does it affect core technologies or is it application-specific?
            - There are proposals that could belong to multiple categories. We choose the category where the majority of the costs go to.
- The report uses cash accounting (for the most part)
    - This means that expenses and income are considered when money changes accounts, not when the actual service is delivered.
    - We strive to arrive at accrual accounting, as it is more in line
    with international accounting practices. But we lack the necessary team
    capacity and data from spends and bounties.
    - This can create distortions, for example when payments are made that extend over the measurement period, or when transactions (like the Myth swap or the Inter Miami deal) are prepaid but not yet executed (and
    might still fail and get refunded). Another example is the new spend()
    extrinsic, which we account for at the time of referendum execution.
    - The current report bases its numbers on the execution date of
    proposals, which can deviate from the time tokens are spent. For past
    reporting, we only represented direct spending from the Treasury and it
    was convenient to represent them on the date of spending.
    - Expenses
        - Loans and liquidity provisions are not represented in the income
        statement, as they do not count as expenses per accounting standards.
        They will show up on the balance sheet
        - Bounty creation & bounty refills are also hidden since these are not yet expended but rather become designated assets. Once they are
        spent via child bounties (or in a single instance fully), expenses are
        accounted.
    - Refunds: We record income from transfers to the Treasury. These
    transactions are most likely refunds from OpenGov proposers that have
    been overpaid or decided not to deliver. However, tracking the origin of these transactions is out of the scope of this report.
- issues
    - we can’t track bounty spends if the bounty decides to liquidate to
    fiat to retain value. this leads to a spend being recorded at the time
    of liquidation
    - similarly, the Marketing Bounty moved some funds to the Polkadot Community Foundation. They are not tracked after leaving the bounty main account and are counted as expenses. We will improve this in future reports.

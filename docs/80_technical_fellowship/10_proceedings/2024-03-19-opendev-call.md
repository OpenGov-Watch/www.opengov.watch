## Hot Topics

### JAM & Polkadot 2.0 Roadmap

- JAM is a candidate design, it is not Polkadot 2.0
- We clarified the project dependencies to make JAM a reality
    - [Alice und Bob summary doc](https://hackmd.io/@alice-und-bob/polkadot2)
    - [Alice und Bob project tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjeKrCjiQHu6szxHdMhR6fHywRT-w0cxou5Ep-UpJFQ/edit#gid=836474213)

#### Questions

- Oliver: How can we ensure we get different client implementations
    - Gavin sees two important things: Having a clear spec. And having proper incentives for different implementations
- Bryan: Ways for devs to participate in development?
    - Gavin: There will be a fund for developers that are helping to build it

#### ISMP as candidate implementation for XCMP

- Seun presented ISMP as a potential implementation of XCMP
- Gavin wasn’t against it :)

### Snowbridge

- Vincent from Snowbridge presented the problem of having to set the DOTETH exchange rate regularly in the BridgeHub storage to properly calculate weights for Ethereum transactions.
- Gavin suggested that users have to obtain wrapped ETH to pay for transactions. This way we could avoid complicating designs.

## Collectives

### Technical Fellowship

#### Release Cadence

- QA and release tempo were discussed.
- Bryan presented a proposal for a [standard release checklist](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/issues/140#issuecomment-1920399473)
- Basti mentioned that writing a QA bounty could be very helpful

#### Fellowship Secretary

Basti proposed to hire a Fellowship secretary: https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/help-center/issues/8

#### Salaries

- Salaries were accidentally 12_000_000 times the intended amount. Payouts luckily capped out at some defined limits.
- Bryan wrote a script to fix it: [Link](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/84)
- Three users got paid out too much and [refunded the excess amount](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/account/13w7NdvSR1Af8xsQTArDtZmVvjE8XhWNdL4yed3iFHrUNCnS?tab=transfer)
